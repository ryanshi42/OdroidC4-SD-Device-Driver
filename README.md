# Odroid C4 MultiMediaCard (MMC) / SD Card / eMMC Device Driver

Odroid C4 SD Card device driver

## Context

* This device driver was originally a Raspberry Pi 3 driver, but due to a lack of existing Odroid C4 MultiMediaCard (MMC) / SD Card / eMMC device drivers that are public, well documented and easy to read, I decided to code my own, with the hopes that someone else may find this useful eventually!
* What is an MMC? Think SD cards as a brief example... they are flash **storage** devices that can be used for a variety of applications.
* The end goal for this was for a completely different reason however, which is to be compatible with the sDDF for seL4. 

## Specifications

* Tested using a microSD card on an Odroid C4.
* Specifications will be updated more when I finish coding
